# Intro to control using MATLAB
A relatively fast-paced introduction to MATLAB, including the basics, plotting, control-related functions and simulink

Made for UCT students taking the third year control course (EEE3094S)

The scripts should be completed in the order,

1. `Intro_to_MATLAB.m`
2. `Intro_to_plotting_using_MATLAB.m`
3. `Intro_to_control_using_MATLAB.m`
4. `Intro_to_control_using_simulink.m`

Feel free to suggest changes, especially to things which weren't well explained.
